# System Engineering DevOps Project

This repository contains all exercises and projects for the ALX System Engineering & DevOps Pathway.

Each task is organized in its respective directory:

- `0x01-shell_permissions` – Tasks on file permissions and script execution
- `0x02-shell_redirections` – Tasks on input/output redirection
- `0x03-shell_variables_expansions` – Tasks on shell variables, expansions, and aliases
- `0x05-processes_and_signals` – Tasks on process management and signals

Each Bash script has:

1. `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as the first line  
2. A comment describing what the script does as the second line  
3. Proper executable permissions (`chmod +x`)  
4. Tested functionality that matches ALX auto-checker requirements
